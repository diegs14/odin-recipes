            <li>1/2 Tsp Ground Ginger</li>

            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Salt</li>
            <li>4 Roasted Red Tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the meat with salt, pepper, and cumin</li>
            <li>Cut open the dried chiles with scissors and remove the seeds</li>
            <li>Fry the dried chiles with a small amount of oil in a frying pan for 2-3 minutes, moving constantly so they don't burn. Set aside</li>
            <li>Add the chiles from the previous step to a small pot with boiling water for about 10 minutes, or until softened. </li>
            <li>In the same frying pan where you fried the chiles, add 1 tablespoon of oil and cook the onions and tomatoes until they are browned. Add the garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and all of the remaining spices except for the ground cumin and ginger. Continue cooking for about 5 minutes, moving it around often. </li>
            <li>Add the chiles (including the water), the ingredients from the previous step, and the ginger, cumin, apple cider vinegar and water to a blender and blend until smooth. It will still be pretty thick, but that is fine. Strain and set aside the resulting sauce for the next step. </li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the meat in a large bowl and cover. You will want to marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight. </li>
            <li>Add the meat with the marinade to a large stockpot and cook over medium heat, covered, for about three hours, or until the meat falls off the bones and is easy to shred.</li> 
        </ol>
        <h3>How to Serve</h3>
        <p>Remove the meat and shred it. You can then serve it over the soup made from the sauce that the meat cooked in or you can serve it with tortillas as tacos with cilantro, lime, onions, and salsa. </p>
